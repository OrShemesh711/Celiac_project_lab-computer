[Naive B cell project]

## Introduction:
In this project we working with Naive B cells data set. 
We will try to create a model that will predict the subject's health status based
 on the features of his repertoire sequences.

## Data Pre-Proccecing:
The data was obtained from a plate of naive B cells derived from blood 
samples of 98 patients, 51 of whom were diagnosed with celiac disease. 
(It is known that there are specific biomarkers that allow us to specifically 
sequence naive B cells with error rates ranging from 10-20%). We get FASTA files,
 which we tranfer in IGBLAST and MAKE_DB algorithms to align the sequences to the
 known human reference. At the end of the MAKE DB process, we have a table that 
the raws represent patient's repertoire sequences, and the different columns 
describe different characteristics of the sequence.

## Project goal:
In this work we will investigate a range of state-of-the-art machine learning 
methods for classification, including random forests, logistic regression and 
support vector regression. These models will be applied to predict the 
clinically-relevant subject states based on observed repertoire features. 
Cross-validation will be used to prevent over-fitting, and feature selection will 
allow for identification of the most relevant properties.

We hope that the tools we develop will pave the way for Ig repertoire data to be
 used for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, and allow for tailored treatment
 for each individual based on their immune system characteristics. 
A satisfying classification model will approve a future low cost test for early
 detection of celiac patients, save unnecessary medical procedures and might
 reveal unique signatures for potential antibodies development.

## Model: 
We utilized a machine learning approach, in order to predicts the clinical group 
based on a combination of the given features. This approach can be utilized not
 only as a prediction model, but it may also be used as a tool to identify 
significant features that did not rise in the single-feature analysis.

For feature selection and prediction model for B cell repertoires, 
we calculated frequency per-sample for each repertoire of sequences.
To avoid false repetroires which may occur due to grouping of several erroneous
 sequences with correct ones, we removed sequences with rare features expression
 that appeared in at low frequencies and/or in less than others. 
In order to be sure that we worked with Naive B cells we filtered 
all sequences with no appropriate isotype, means that all the sequences 
we work with are from IGM/IGD isotype(These isotypes characterize the naive cells).

We applied Random Forests model to extract the best 20 features,
 followed by utilization of different models on the selected 
features to generate the prediction model. The process of sampling 
and training was repeated K times, to ensure that the model was not 
biased towards specific samples.
